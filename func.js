/*
- a first-class citizen is an entity that can be put in a variable
- a higher-order function is a function that does at least one of the following:
    - takes one or more functions as arguments (i.e. procedural parameters),
    - returns a function as its result.
- currying is the technique of converting a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument
